##Factory specifications

Our factory will have two steps.

### 1. making_dough: 
to make dough it will take in 'water' and 'flour'.

inputs = 'water' and 'flour'

outputs = 'dough'

### 2. baking_dough:
The 'dough' we should be able to put in an oven, where Naan comes out.

input = 'dough'

output = 'Naan'

### 3. factory_run
Lastly we should just be able to give the factory the water and flour to get the Naan

##Factory objectives

Our factory should take in water and flour to make dough.

Then with the dough, we should  be able to put inside an oven.

Out of the oven you should get out a Naan bread.

Lastly we should just be able to give the factory the water and flour and get Naan.

this is a repo for our Naan factory :bread:
- the learning outcomes include :
- github
- markdown
- TDD
- Functional Programming & best practices
- DRY Principles
- Separation of Concerns

## How to run the programme
Run the naan_factory_run.py file

##how to run the tests
Run the naan_factory_tests.py file

#basis of a test
##You'll be testing functions or methods, these need to be called or initialised
###having controlled inputs for known outputs
    ### and testing for these

##Factory specifications

Our factory will have two steps.

### 1. making_dough: 
to make dough it will take in 'water' and 'flour'.

inputs = 'water' and 'flour'

outputs = 'dough'

### 2. baking_dough:
The 'dough' we should be able to put in an oven, where Naan comes out.

input = 'dough'

output = 'Naan'

### 3. factory_run
Lastly we should just be able to give the factory the water and flour to get the Naan

inputs = 'water' and 'flour'

outputs = Naan

##Factory objectives

Our factory should take in water and flour to make dough.

Then with the dough, we should  be able to put inside an oven.

Out of the oven you should get out a Naan bread.

Lastly we should just be able to give the factory the water and flour and get Naan.



#DOD(definition of done)
For project:
- it is a project, by itself
- it includes a README.md file
- it includes a .gitignore file
- it has  a separate github repository
#The Naan Bread Factory - project
- what does Naan include?
- yeast(flour)
- water
--> = dough
- shape --> oval dough
- and bake it
- --> Naan bread
#machine 1: make dough
- water + flour = dough
#machine 2(oven): make Naan

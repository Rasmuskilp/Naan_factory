#Basis of a test
#Having controlled inputs for known outputs
    #and testing for these
# #Make test for make_dough
# #to make dough it will take in 'water' and 'flour'
# inputs = 'water' and 'flour'
# outputs = 'dough'
print(make_dough('water','four') == 'dough'
#Make test for bake_dough
#then with the dough should be able to put it to even and get out Naan
print(bake_dough('dough')) == 'Naan'
